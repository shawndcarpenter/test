# Thoughts Thusfar

## Takeaways
1. This is my first time using any of this software, but I feel that I am picking it up quickly. I've felt more engaged in the assignments that I've done so far than most of what I did in college, which is a good sign.
2. Maintaining a routine through calendaring has helped me keep track of how quickly I can get through assignments, as well as how much of a break I need in-between. I've realized that:
- Sometimes it's better to let myself stay in the flow and move onto the next assignment when I feel I still have the energy and focus, rather than stricly following my calendar
- Life will throw many curveballs (such as the laptop provided having a faulty chip) but I have the ability to find strategies to overcome them (taking the Mac to an Apple Store, sending it off for repairs, and completing the computer setup on an old personal MacBook)

## Strategies
1. I will rework my calendar to reflect what I have found to be my most productive timeslots:
- 10am to 2pm
- 6pm to 10pm
2. I will spend extra time practicing coding using the commands learned in live sessions and assignments, especially those which I may struggle to commit to memory.
